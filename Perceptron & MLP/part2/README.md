1. Use part2.ipynb(I changed learning rate to 1e-1 for better result. To use different parameters, need to modify this file) or run train_mlp_numpy.py with desired arguments. (One extra argument: “—task 2”  to run task 2.)

If you see “WORKING”, PLEASE wait patiently as it might takes minutes to finish running and then show the plot.
